# Word Search Puzzle Solver
The Word Search Puzzle Solver project aims to create a robust and user-friendly tool that generates and solves word search puzzles with customizable difficulty levels and themed word lists (such as, christmas, halloween, etc.) . The solutions have been generated via various algorithms to demonstrate their comparative efficiency. 

# Objectives:
 The project aims to provide users with a tool that not only finds solutions to word search puzzles but also allows them to explore and compare different solving algorithms. The specific objectives include:
 ● Developaninteractive user interface allowing users to select difficulty levels and themes. <br/>
 ● Implementalgorithms to generate word search puzzles based on selected parameters. <br/>
 ● Implementthree different algorithms, Backtracking, Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Breadth First Search, for solving the generated puzzles. <br/>
 ● Evaluate the efficiency of the Backtracking, Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Breadth First Search algorithms in solving word search puzzles. <br/>
 ● Enableusers to interactively input their guesses for word search puzzles and compare their guesses with the results provided.
